RockStar Of Design #ROD - BigRock Inc.
======================================

This is my entry for the BigRock Inc. contest <a href="http://www.rockstarofdesign.net/">RockStar Of Design(ROD)</a>.

We have worked on an HTML5 Responsive design for the their homepage. With a dark theme and utilizing the modern Flat UI
using technologies like HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Twitter Bootstrap, Angular JS by Google etc.

- It simulates an entire purchase flow for Domain Names at BigRock 
  (including pages like Domain check availability, cart page, sign up page and so on)
  Just start by clicking on Search Button on index.html.
  
- No back-end connectivity, but still we demod a simple domain purchase with Angular JS.

- Place holder and all the content have be sourced from the existing BigRock website.

- No trademark infringing materials used in developing the website.
  BigRock owns rights to all virtual properties like design, structure etc. of the submission
